Version 0.9.10.04
================
Changes

	o	year(), month(), day() functions have methods for Date and POSIXt objects.

        then applies the "character" signature method.

Version 0.9.10.01
================
Changes

	o	Replaced S4 methods cbind and rbind with functions cbindmondate and rbindmondate. This removed the two Internal calls in the package. As a result, the functionality is slightly changed:
		- Whereas mondate's and non-mondate's could previously be c/r-binded together with the result being a mondate, such a "mixed combination" now results in a data.frame. If necessary, non-mondates should be coerced to mondates ahead of time. 
		- When all the arguments are mondates, the result is a mondate as before.
		- The user will no longer see the message about the c/r-bind generics being created when the package is loaded.
		- Base c/r-bind with mondate arguments act on the Data slot of the mondates.

	o	The as.numeric method now assignes the names attribute of the mondate, if it exists. Before, only the dimnames attribute was assigned.

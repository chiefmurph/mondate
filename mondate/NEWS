Version 0.10.01.01
==================
Changes

	o	A new cut.mondate method
        - Fashioned after a combination of cut.default and cut.Date
        - Adheres to the "end-of-business-day" spirit of "mondate"
            *   When dates are used in the identification of the intervals
                within the levels, the last day of the interval is the
                default. Can be over-ridden with "right = FALSE".
            *   Intervals are represented by default as left-open /
                right-closed. This is in agreement with cut.default.
        -   include-lowest = TRUE by default. This ensures that the
            minimum value of the mondate is included in the first
            level. The first interval, therefore, is also left-closed.
            This is probably an issue only when breaks is a scalar.
        -   A-la cut.Date, allows the capability of an integer step when 
            breaks is "days", "weeks", "months", "quarters", or "years".
    o   Net + and - methods for mondate,difftime signatures to simplify
        adding and subtracting non-"months": "secs", "mins", "hours",
        "days", abd "weeks"
        -   Example mondate("2013-01-01") + difftime(1, units = "days")
    o   A new "formatFUN" slot
        -   The purpose of this slot is to allow for the user to define
            a special formatting function for converting mondate's to
            character. For example, there is no format string that 
            will format dates in terms of calendar quarter, but this
            can now be accomplished by specifying 'formatFUN' when
            the mondate is created.
        -   A function that will represent mondate's in YYYYQ* format,
            for * = 1-4, is exported in mondate's namespace under the
            name 'YearQuartersFormat'.
        -   The default value of formatFUN is NULL, in which case
            mondate uses the previous behavior -- i.e., formatting
            as a date according to the displayFormat of the mondate.
    o   A new "quarters" S3 method 
        -   Returns the "Q1 - Q3" representation of the calendar quarter 
            of the mondate. Same behavior as the quarters.Date method.
    o   A new "quarter" S4 generic with methods for mondate, Date, POSIXt
        -   Returns the numeric value of the calendar quarter.

Bug Fixes
    o   The default values for displayFormat (especially) and timeunits
        were not being set correctly on package load. As a result,
        the default displayFormat was always the international date standard
        even when the user's locale was in the United States.
        These values are now being determined at the time 
        a mondate instance is created.
        
Version 0.9.10.04
================
Changes
	o	year(), month(), day() functions have methods for Date and POSIXt objects.
	o   New "factor" signature for 'mondate' method converts factor to character
        then applies the "character" signature method.
    o   ymd() function retains names of argument if available

Version 0.9.10.01
================
Changes
	o	Replaced S4 methods cbind and rbind with functions cbindmondate and rbindmondate. This removed the two Internal calls in the package. As a result, the functionality is slightly changed:
		- Whereas mondate's and non-mondate's could previously be c/r-binded together with the result being a mondate, such a "mixed combination" now results in a data.frame. If necessary, non-mondates should be coerced to mondates ahead of time. 
		- When all the arguments are mondates, the result is a mondate as before.
		- The user will no longer see the message about the c/r-bind generics being created when the package is loaded.
		- Base c/r-bind with mondate arguments act on the Data slot of the mondates.

	o	The as.numeric method now assignes the names attribute of the mondate, if it exists. Before, only the dimnames attribute was assigned.


Version 0.9.9.01
================
Bug Fixes
   
================
NEW FEATURES
   o New 'as.mondate' function for coercing R objects to a mondate
================
Changes
   o Reverted any S4 method better implemented as S3 to an S3 version. 
	In particular, 'format' and 'unique' enable 'aggregate' to work
	with a mondate object specified in 'by' argument
   o Removed deprecated 'displayFormat' argument from as.character.mondate method
   o Clarified some of the documentation

Base
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
provides two broad classes for representing dates, 
`POSIXt` and `Date`.
Objects of these classes
conform with 
international
standards^[Refer to http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm
by marking a "day" with the instant of
time that begins the day.
It is straightforward to calculate 
elapsed time in units of "days" using those objects.
However, frequent business-use cases express elapsed time
in units of "months" or "years"
and the definition of "month" or "year" in units of "days"
is ambiguous.

The "mondate" package adopts a different perspective.
It is based on three principles:

1. A "month" is marked with the instant in time that 
"closes business" that month.
2. A "day" is marked with the instant in time that "closes business" that day
and is represented by the portion of the month
that has completed by the end of that day.
3. A "year" equals twelve "months".

`mondate` objects constructed according to these principles 
make it straightforward to calculate
elapsed time in units of "months" and "years."

The purpose of this vignette is to highlight the usefulness of the
"mondate" package in everyday and business situations that
inherently express time in units of "months" or "years."
Technical looks "under the mondate hood" will only be 
touched on for clarification.

The four major benefits of the mondate package are:

1. Date Aging
1. Date Formatting
1. Date Sequencing
1. Date Cutting

## 1. Date Aging

The "age" of an event plays many important roles in business use cases.
By default, `Date` objects are measured in units of "days" and `POSIXt` objects in 
units of "seconds".
But sometimes it is more convenient to measure elapsed time in units of 
"months" or "years".
This is where `mondate` comes in.

#### Example 1 
If my "birth event" took place on February 29, 1996
then my age on February 28, 2006 was 10:

```{r birthday}
require(mondate)
YearsBetween("1996-02-29", "2006-02-28")
```
or in the US
```{r}
YearsBetween("2/29/1996", "2/28/2006")
```
and
```{r}
MonthsBetween("2/29/1996", "2/28/2006")
```
which also results when subtracting two `mondate`s
```{r}
m1 <- mondate.ymd(1996, 2)
m2 <- mondate.ymd(2006, 2)
m2 - m1
```

#### Example 2
Suppose ABC Company invoices a customer in late October 2015
and has a policy of recognizing that invoice to have been sent
on the 1st of November.
This code calculates the ages of that invoice in months 
as of the ends of 2015 and 2016:

```{r}
invoiceDate = as.Date("2015-11-01")
asof <- mondate.ymd(2015:2016)
ages <- asof - invoiceDate
print(ages)
```

#### Example 3
The last example in this section is actuarial in nature.
Suppose ABC Insurance Co. stores the date of insured losses in the variable
(or data base field)
DateOfLoss. 
Here are 10 random dates of loss after the end of 2010:
```{r}
# generate 10 random dates after 2010
set.seed(1)
z <- rexp(10, .1)
DateOfLoss <- as.Date(mondate.ymd(2010) + z)
names(DateOfLoss) <- paste0("Claim", 1:10)
print(DateOfLoss)
```
Here are the four quarter-end "as-of dates" in 2013:
```{r}
# Quarter-ends in 2013
asof <- mondate.ymd(2013, 3 * 1:4)
names(asof) <- paste0("Q", 1:4)
print(asof)
```

Comment:  
"names" were assigned to `DateOfLoss` and `asof`
so that
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
will automatically embellish the 
data.frame below with row and column headers.

Here are the ages of the 10 losses as of each quarter end,
stored in a data.frame with each claim's date of loss:

```{r}
# a matrix of ages in units of months
Ages <- round(sapply(asof, `-` , DateOfLoss), 1)
# code ages as "not available" if the evaluation date preceeds 
# the Date of Loss (one instance)
Ages[Ages <= 0] <- NA
data.frame(DateOfLoss, Ages)
```

### Date Arithmetic

`mondate`s can act arithmetically in (almost always) the same way
their underlying `numeric` can 
act.^[The underlying `numeric` measures the number of months since 
the close of business 1999-12-31 (".mondate.origin").]
In particular, 
use subtraction to measure the magnitude of the interval between 
two dates in units of months.

For example, the following two calculations yield the same result:

```{r}
mondate("2015-12-31") - mondate("2014-12-31")
mondate("2015-12-31") - as.Date("2015-01-01")
```

Why are the results identical
even though the subtrahends would appear to be a day apart? 
The answer is that the two objects,
`as.Date("2015-01-01")` and `mondate("2014-12-31")`
*represent the same instant in time*,
i.e.,
the moment that separates events occuring in 2014 from
events occurring in 2015.

![star](star.png)
This points out a new feature in mondate v1.0:
*`Date`s can be subracted directly from `mondate`s.*

##2. Date Formatting

`mondate` enables dates to be read and displayed in more than one format.
The built-in formats that are automatically recognized are currently

1. USa: "%m/%d/%Y"
1. USb: "%m-%d-%Y"
1. EUa: "%Y-%m-%d"
1. EUb: "%Y/%m/%d"

The order can be changed and new formats added using `base::options`
for display ("writing") and 
`set.mondate.displayFormats` for "reading".

### "writing": dynamic format display

By default,
`mondate` looks at your value of `Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME")` at startup.
If "United States" appears, then USa format is selected,
otherwise, EUa is selected.
This default can be changed globally for all `mondate`
objects in the session or for indivisual objects.

#### Example 4
This vignette is being written in the US, 
so today's date,
`r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")`,
will be represented using the first format above by default:

```{r}
mondate(Sys.Date())
```

That default can be changed to the
international standard format^[ibid.]
"YYYY-MM-DD" using
`base::options` and the name
`mondate.default.displayFormat`:

```{r}
options(mondate.default.displayFormat = "%Y-%m-%d")
mondate(Sys.Date())
```

#### Example 5 
French users of the format "dd/mm/YYYY" can
establish that default as follows:

```{r}
options(mondate.default.displayFormat = "%d/%m/%Y")
mondate(Sys.Date())
```

![star](star.png)
The `options` approach modifies the default display format
for **all** mondates in the 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
session.
To set the display format for **just one** instance of a mondate object,
use the `displayFormat` argument during the object's creation.

#### Example 6
Here we create the first 6 month-ends of 2015
to be displayed in the French format above
despite the fact that the default format is first changed to the ISO standard:

```{r}
options(mondate.default.displayFormat = "%Y-%m-%d")
mondate(Sys.Date())
m <- mondate.ymd(2015, 1:6, displayFormat = "%d/%m/%Y")
print(m)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(mondate.displayFormat = NULL)
```
```{r}

```

More creative formats can be used, 
as for instance
to display just the year and month,
as was done in "Example 3" above.
```{r echo=FALSE}
options(mondate.default.displayFormat = NULL)
```

### "reading": dynamic format detection

As previously mentioned,
the `mondate` package has the four formats
paste(get.mondate.displayFormats(), collapse=", ")
for detecting whether a character string represents a "date."
To inform `mondate` of another format for converting character to date,
use `set.mondate.displayFormats`^[This function sets the `options` value of
`mondate.displayFormats`]
with the value(s) of your choice.

#### Example 7
To set the French format "dd/mm/yyyy" as Priority One 
for detecting dates, 
add that format
to the *head* of the
current list of detectable formats.
The  
code
below accomplishes 
that.^[This example is given in ?set.mondate.displayFormats]:

```{r}
set.mondate.displayFormats(c("%d/%m/%Y", 
                             get.mondate.displayFormats()), 
                           clear = TRUE)
```

Contining, 
suppose dates in a spreadsheet are saved to a csv file in France
and the `read.csv` function results in this data.frame:
```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  cbind(Invoice=c("A", "B", "C"),
        datechar = c("28/11/2015", "29/11/2015", "30/11/2015")))
print(data)
```
The character dates can be converted automatically to `Date` objects
via `mondate` as follows
```{r}
data$InvoiceDate <- as.Date(mondate(data$datechar))
print(data)
```

For more information on the codes to use when formatting dates,
see the 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
help page for the `strptime` function.
To add addtional defaults according to your value of
`Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME")`,

author^[chiefmurphy at gmail].

https://github.com/chiefmurph/mondate.)

##3. Date Sequencing

Sequences of dates in units of days
or weeks is easily accomplished using the base 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>'s `Date` class:  
```{r} 
seq(as.Date("2015-11-01"), by = "day", length.out = 5)
```
Month-sequences can similarly be generated with `Date`s, 
which does work well
for most dates.
Results can be disappointing,
however,
for dates near the end of the month.
Compare these two sequences
starting from the first and last days of January:
```{r}
seq(as.Date("2015-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 5)
seq(as.Date("2015-01-31"), by = "month", length.out = 5)
```
All dates in the first sequence are the first days of the month,
but some dates in the second sequence "leak" into subsequent months.
This behavior is well documented in
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
help^[see `?seq.POSIXt`]:

>Using "month" first advances the month without changing the day: if this results in an invalid day of the month, it is counted forward into the next month

Perhaps the major purpose of the mondate package
is to avoid this 
shortcoming.^["Under the hood" `mondate` represent dates 
relative to the 
percent of the month that has transpired by the close of business that day.
Kudos to Damien Laker! See the "Thank You" section at the end.]

#### Example 8
Sequences of month ends can be accomplished in various "mondate" ways.
Here are two:
```{r}
seq(mondate("2015-01-31"), by = "month", length.out = 5)
mondate.ymd(2015, 1:5)
```
The display format in the first sequence inherits from the
format of the character representation of the beginning date.
The display format in the second sequence is based on the 
author's locale (see "Date Formatting" section above).
Also note that each of the objects generated above are of class "mondate".

![star](star.png)
It is often more convenient to generate month sequences from `Date` objects,
**and produce `Date` objects**,
without having to resort to a `mondate` object in between.
For that purpose the `seqmondate` generic function was written.

### seqmondate
`seqmondate(x)` generates sequences of class(x) for a variety of classes:
`Date`, `POSIXt`, and `mondate`.
For any other class(x) `seqmondate(x)` will produce a sequence of
`mondate`s, if possible.
By default, 'by = "month"' is assumed.

#### Example 9

The first sequence below generates the same month-ends as in Example 8
but this time the objects generated are `Date`s.

```{r}
(d <- seqmondate(as.Date("2015-01-01"), length = 5))
class(d)
```

#### Example 10: Year-ends
It has been said that there are always multiple ways to do things in 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
and this is no exception.
Here are two ways to generate sequences of year-end dates.

```{r}
seqmondate("2010-12-31", by = "year", length = 6)
mondate.ymd(2010:2015)
```

![star](star.png)
If month- and year-end dates are intended to represent "as of" dates,
it is preferable to create them as `mondate` objects rather than, say,
`Date` objects if those dates will be used for "date aging" in units of
months/years.

## 4. Date Cutting

>**Sidebar on "cut" for numerics**  
A `cut` of a `numeric` 'x' is a collection of (half-open,half-closed]
intervals that "cover" 'x'.
By "cover" is meant that every value in 'x' is contained in some 
interval^[thus, not an "open cover" in the topological sense],
with the exception that 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
excludes 
the minimum value of 'x' by default.^[unless 
you set `include.lowest = TRUE`]
By default, the right endpoint is assumed to be closed.^[change 
the interval to left-closed by setting `right = FALSE`]

>A `cut` in 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
is represented by a `factor`.
The `cut` function elegantly enunciates
the `numeric` intervals by clearly identifying the 
(open,closed] borders
in the factor's levels.

<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
Definition:
A `cut` of a set of dates 'x' by "months" is
a collection of contiguous months such that every date in x is contained in
some month.

This correspondence between a date and its neighboring members in its 'cut'
can be an important factor
in the statistical analysis of events occurring during similar time periods.

There is a `cut` method for `mondate`s when the 'breaks' argument is

* `numeric` and so determines 
the borders between intervals, or
* `character` and so identifies that the cover is to be a set of
day-, week-, month-, year-, or 
quarter-intervals.

First we will define some cuts.
Then we will see how one might use a `cut`.

####Example 11
Because a `mondate` is fundamentally a 
`numeric`^[the "mondate class" is defined via
`setClass("mondate", contains = "numeric"`, etc.], 
the following two commands --
the first on `numeric`, the second on `mondate` --
are fundamentally the same.
The only difference is how the cuts' levels display.

```{r}
cut(seq(from = 180.5, to = 185.5, by = .5), breaks = 180:186)
cut(seq(from = mondate(180.5), to = mondate(185.5), by = .5), breaks = 180:186)
```

In the month intervals above, 
if one were to label the interval with one of the endpoints,
it seems natural to choose the closed endpoint.
That is the 'mondate' convention when 'breaks' is `character`.
This bears repeating:

![star](star.png)
>The 'mondate' convention is to label a *character cut*
(breaks = "days", "months", ...)
with the **closed endpoint** of the interval.
As with `cut.default`, the closed endpoint is determined by
the argument `right`:
when `TRUE` the right endpoint labels the interval,
when `FALSE` the left endpoint labels the interval.

We begin with examples of `mondate` cuts, 
with `breaks` being `numeric` and `character`.

####Example 12

The following two commands generate the same cut.
The first explicitly sets the break points with the 
month-ends beginning 2014-12-31 and ending six months later.
The second implicitly sets the same break points.
As with `cut.default`,
the labels of the first cut clearly enunciate the
(open,closed] monthly intervals.
The labels of the second cut only display 
the closed endpoint.
```{r}
cut(seq(mondate("2015-01-15"), mondate("2015-06-15"), by = .5), 
    breaks = mondate.ymd(2014) + 0:6)
cut(seq(mondate("2015-01-15"), mondate("2015-06-15"), by = .5), breaks = "month",
    include.lowest = TRUE)
```

In the case that breaks is `character` it is unfortunate to have to 
set `include.lowest = TRUE`, 
opposite its default value 
`FALSE`.^[Excluding the minimum value of 'x' would be somewhat *random* 
-- forgive the colloquialism --
given
that other values of 'x' are likely to in the same time interval.
In the case of `character` breaks,
`include.lowest=FALSE` throws an error.]
Other `cut` arguments as well have default values that may seem 
counterintuitive
for cutting dates.

Perhaps the most troubling default is `right = TRUE` for `Date` objects 
because it violates 
the basic principle that `Date` objects begin on,
and can be considered synonymous with,
the instant beginning the day,
i.e., the *left* endpoint.

![star](star.png)
For those and other reasons,
a `cutmondate` method was written to work on `Date`, `mondate`, and other objects
with arguments that are more appropriate for their class.
Additionally,
three new arguments were added to `cut.mondate`, 
which we will cover in due course.

We now turn our attention to the `cutmondate` methods.

### cutmondate

The 'cutmondate' collection of methods are most effective when 
'breaks' defines a cover in terms of months or multiple months.

![star](star.png)
When the object being cut is a `Date` or `POSIXt`,
the breakpoints are assumed to begin the period,
right = FALSE by default,
and the levels are labeled by the 
first date in the period.
If necessary,
the labels can be set to the right endpoint with `right = TRUE`.

####Example 13

Here we regenerate the same DateOfLoss dates from Example 3, 
and cut them into month intervals.
```{r}
set.seed(1)
z <- rexp(10, .1)
monDOL <- mondate.ymd(2010) + z
DateOfLoss <- as.Date(monDOL)
print(DateOfLoss)
cutmondate(DateOfLoss)
```
The "28 Levels" says that it takes 28 contiguous months to cover 'DateOfLoss'.
Note that the levels are labeled with the first day of each month because
in this case
`right=FALSE` by default.
Specify `right=TRUE` and the levels are labeled by
the last day of the month,
which occurs by default in the second, `mondate` case below:
```{r}
cutmondate(DateOfLoss, right = TRUE)
cutmondate(monDOL)
```

Before tackling the final examples,
it is important to point out three new arguments for `cut.mondate`
(and therefore for `cutmondate`)
that do not appear in `cut.default` or `cut.Date`:

* startmonth
* startyear
* attr.breaks = FALSE

See the help for `cut.mondate` for details behind these arguments. 
We will show use of the first and third.

### Fiscal Years

![star](star.png)
The 'startmonth' argument enables *fiscal year cuts*!

####Example 14

Suppose ABC's fiscal year is July 1 through June 30. 
The dates of loss in the previous examples can be cut into fiscal years
by setting startmonth = 7.

Here we show two ways to cut DateOfLoss by fiscal year,
the choice depending on whether the company identifies its fiscal year
with the beginning day or ending day of the period.

```{r}
cutmondate(DateOfLoss, breaks = "year", startmonth = 7)
cutmondate(DateOfLoss, breaks = "year", startmonth = 7, right = TRUE)
```

Continuing, suppose ABC Company conventually refers to a fiscal year
not by "the beginning date" but
by the first calendar year.
The dates can be cut and the abbreviated labels automatically generated
in the single function call

```{r}
cutmondate(mondate(DateOfLoss, displayFormat = "%Y"), 
           breaks = "year", right = FALSE, startmonth = 7)
```

In the final example we aggregate and plot data by fiscal year.

####Example 15

ABC Insurance Co. records loss amounts associated with the dates of loss at 
regular intervals. 
Suppose the amounts as of 2016-06-30 are
```{r}
(LossAmount <- round(rnorm(10, 1000, 100), -1))
```

ABC's actuaries want to aggregate loss by age.
The C-Suite wants aggregations by fiscal year.
Everyone wants visuals!
No problem.

First, cut the loss dates into fiscal years (FY), 
but this time also use
`attr.breaks = TRUE`.

![star](star.png)
To make the break points available for subsequent date aging,
set `attr.breaks = TRUE` in `cutmondate`.

```{r}
FY <- cutmondate(mondate(DateOfLoss, displayFormat = "%Y"), 
           breaks = "year", right = FALSE, startmonth = 7,
           attr.breaks = TRUE)
asof <- mondate.ymd(2016, 6)
age <- asof - attr(FY, "breaks")[FY]
(data <- data.frame(DateOfLoss, LossAmount, FY, FYage = age))
```

Calculate loss totals --
here we use `aggregate` --
and plot those totals --
here we use base <span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
graphics.
The first plot is by FY, the second by FY age.

```{r}
(LossByFY <- aggregate(LossAmount ~ FY, data, sum))
barplot(LossByFY$LossAmount, names.arg = LossByFY$FY, xlab = "Fiscal Year",
        main = "Total Loss")
# and
(LossByFYage <- aggregate(LossAmount ~ FYage, data, sum))
barplot(LossByFYage$LossAmount, names.arg = LossByFYage$FYage,
        xlab = paste("Fiscal Year Age (mos) as of", asof),
        main = "Total Loss")
```

## Summary

The mondate package represents dates in a way that
enables date aging and sequencing in a mathematically "invertible"
manner.^[Invertible in the sense that retracing a monthly sequence 
from the end should 
produce the same sequence but in reverse order.
That is not always possible with `Date` sequences by "month".
Consider that  
seq(as.Date("2015-01-31"), by = "month", length.out = 2)  
yields  
"2015-01-31" "2015-03-03"  
whereas  
seq(as.Date("2015-03-03"), by = "-1 month", length.out = 2)  
yields  
"2015-03-03" "2015-02-03"]

A `mondate` object is not appropriate for all situations.
For example, 
a `mondate` halfway through the month of February
falls on the close of business of the 14th day
(in  most cases)
but falls on the 15th day for April.
If a time period other than month or year is more suited
to the situation,
use an 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
object other than `mondate`.

Factors that associate similar events by date can be created
by 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>'s
`cut` methods.
A `cut` method exists for `mondate` objects but the preferable
function to use for cutting those and other 
date-representing objects (`Date`, `POSIXt`)
is `cutmondate` because the arguments default to values 
intuitively appropriate for the object.

## Thank you

Many thanks to the 
<span style="color:blue; font-family:Georgia;">R</span>
Development team for their work on
`Date` and `POSIXt` objects and methods.

A special thank you goes out to Gabor Grothendieck for his suggestion of,
and help with,
`cut.mondate`.

Finally,
the "mondate perspective" was motivated by 
Damien Laker
in his somewhat obscure 2008 paper
*Time Calculations for Annualizing Returns: The Need for 
Standardization*^[The Journal of Performance Measurement, Summer 2008]
where he states the obvious :-) 

>"Annualization calculations based on whole
months never wind up accidentally calculating that a
year is anything other than a year long."

Mr. Laker's *Recommended Method* is based on two cases:^[Ibid.
Although the terms "start on" and "finishes on" are not specifically
defined in Mr. Laker's paper,
the spirit is intuitively understood and reflected in the package.]

1. "For any period that starts and finishes on the last day of a
month, the time calculation can be done entirely in
months."
2. "In cases where the start date or end date is not the last
day of a month, it will be necessary to count a partial
month."

The mondate package embraces this end-of-business,
month-centric, 
a-year-equals-twelve-months perspective.
